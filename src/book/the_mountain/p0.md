# The Meta-story

> Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift,

> nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge,

This story has exactly four endings.
It has four endings due to the input of two boolean variables:
a choice and a consequence. Consider a case in which you flip two coins.
There are four possible outcomes, two heads, two tails, a heads then a tails,
or a tails then a heads. Using normal coins, each of those outcomes as a 
25% chance of happening.

This story is much like flipping two coins. But there's a twist: these aren't
fair coins we're flipping.
